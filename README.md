# research_internship_outline_and_results
This repository contains an outline of the learning progress and results obtained during my first internship (UCL Bioinformatics research group).


#### Goals 
1. perform well on the [PAIP2019](https://paip2019.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/) challenge
2. additinally, (if time and data available) extend results from previous disertation paper on analysis of nuclear images from soft tissue sarcoma

### Outline
* week1: 
  * learn the underlying concepts of artificial neural networks (! CNNS) and how to use the pytorch library
    - [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/home/welcome)
    - [basic tutorial on PyTorch](http://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg)
    - [machine learning and deep learning fundamentals](http://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg)
  * become familiar with terminology of the digital pathology pipeline 
    (read research papers on state of the art practices in histopathological analysis)
  * get data for the PAIP challenge
