# research_internship_outline_and_results
This repository contains an outline of the learning progress and results obtained during my first internship (UCL Bioinformatics research group).


#### Goals 
1. perform well on the [PAIP2019](https://paip2019.grand-challenge.org/Dataset/) challenge
2. additinally, (if time and data available) extend results from previous disertation paper on analysis of nuclear images from soft tissue sarcoma

#### Building blocks
   1. Become familiar with the research workflow - read research papers, histopathology pipeline, machine learning techniques and plactices
   2. Programming - become familiar with PyTorch, TensorFlow (maybe Keras)
   3. Deep learning/Machine learning algorithms - ! CNNs architectures

### Outline
* week1: 
  * learn the underlying concepts of artificial neural networks (! CNNS) and how to use the pytorch library
    - [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks/home/welcome)
    - [basic tutorial on PyTorch](http://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg)
    - [machine learning and deep learning fundamentals](http://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg)
    - [CS231n notes](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/)
  * become familiar with terminology of the digital pathology pipeline
    (read research papers on practices in histopathological analysis)
  * get data for the PAIP challenge
  * look on code from [amazing PyTorch repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)
* week2:
  * more CNNs [Stanford - CS231n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SlgtELqOWc&list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk&index=8)
  * [CNNs from scratch](https://github.com/karyam/research_internship_outline_and_results/tree/master/cnn_scratch)
  * work through all the notebooks from deeplearning.ai
  * get familiar with data processing techniques
  * read more papers on HE analysis
  * work on assignments from CS231n, [nice solutions](https://github.com/srinadhu/CS231n)
  * [training DNNs advice](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)
  * CNNs in Pytorch for CIFAR10
  * re-work through [best PyTorch tutorial](https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models/blob/master/README.md)
* week3:
  * start looking on PAIP data, preprocessing techniques
  * reproduce results from various research papers
  * research for state-of-the art algorithms
